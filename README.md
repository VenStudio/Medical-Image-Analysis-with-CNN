# Medical Image Analysis with CNN

---

## Overview

This project develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to analyze medical images like X-rays or MRIs for disease detection and identifying abnormalities. Utilizing TensorFlow and OpenCV, it enhances diagnostic accuracy from medical image data.

## Purpose

This system helps:

- **Automated Disease Detection:** Simplify and speed up diagnosing diseases from medical images.
- **Data Organization:** Extract and organize image data for better insights.
- **Accuracy Improvement:** Use advanced CNN architectures and preprocessing techniques to enhance detection accuracy.

## Usage

1. **Set Up:** Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib numpy
   ```
